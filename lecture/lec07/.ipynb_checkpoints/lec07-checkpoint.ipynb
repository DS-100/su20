Often you will acquire or even be given a collection of data in order to conduct some analysis or answer some questions. The first step in using that data is to ensure that it is in the correct form (cleaned) and that you understand its properties and limitations (EDA).  Often as you explore data through EDA you will identify additional transformations that may be required before the data is ready for analysis.\n",
